        <h3>Keeping Your Soul Pure and Your Pocketbook Full</h3>
        <p>
        There are billions of people on this planet.  Nearly every single one of these people would like to be financially comfortable.  Sure, there are some ascetic exceptions; monks, wandering nomads, survivalists... they are to be lauded for their forbearance and frugality.  But, remarkable as they may be, these are total statistical outliers.  Most people will just do what they will to succeed in life, sometimes to the detriment of the purity of their souls.  Really, does anybody, even a saint, make it out with his soul completely intact?
        </p>
        <p>
		Let's put this "soul searching" aside for a minute, and talk business.  When you look at those aforementioned "exceptional" examples, you'll notice that these people have adjusted the power of thought processes in order to attain seemingly impossible goals.  Although it is in the complete opposite direction, this is interestingly enough the same "mind over matter" variety of mental metamorphosis one needs to undertake in order to achieve great financial success. The power of the brain is very often misunderstood, and even more often underestimated.
        </p>
		<p>
		How many different self-help / personal success books have you seen in your life?  Material mysticism really came into its own during the early part of the 20th century, and has become rather ubiquitous.  As a rather profound testament to its great prevalence, even several Christian congregations have altered or abridged their creeds in total sympathy to the power of the mind to acquire matter.
        </p>
        <p>
		So, if so many people are aware of - and enthralled by - the possibility of simply conceiving and believing in order to end up achieving, how come all these people are not millionaires?  It's an obvious question with an obvious answer... they're not doing it right.  Even though they have the will to succeed, their power of thought is not in the right place.
        </p>
		<p>  
		For one thing, everyday fixations within one's mind over matter and material ends should not cross over and short-circuit one's religious faith.  Whether you believe in Jesus or not, you've got to admit he was a pretty decent teacher.  Just as many of his lessons challenge and admonish those who would mix material ambition and faith together, so do the best personal success authors.
        </p>
        <p>
		Faith is something beyond the material, and needs room to be fully sustained so that it might fully inform your material side.  Is this clear?  Simply put, pray for thanksgiving and forgiveness and not for money or goods.  Let the pure faith side take a load off your material side from time to time, allowing it to work its way through all the snags and crevices.
        </p>
        <p>
		Maybe we're getting a little bit too didactic, theological, and mystical here.  Really, the whole point is that morality and wealth are not mutually exclusive, but instead must be carefully balanced.  In general, balance is one of the most important virtues of financial success.  Just as you can train your body to be strong and stay balanced in awkward positions, so too can you train your brain to think powerfully and clearly under confusing, high-pressure circumstances.  This kind of training is absolutely essential to attaining great wealth.
        </p>
        <p>
		So once you've developed your mind, how do you apply it?  You can tap into the power of thought to achieve your own desired success.  The innate ability is inside of us all, waiting to be awakened.  It is all too easy to dwell on yesterday's setbacks, looking backwards instead of developing a success consciousness that will drive you forward towards your goals. 
        </p>
        <p>
		The journey towards success is like any other journey.  If you want to reach your destination quickly, you need a map showing the roads, towns and villages along the way; i.e. where are you going and how do you get there?  In the same way, successful individuals identify the intermediate steps along the way to the ultimate goal. The key to business success is systematically identifying attainable targets and working towards reaching them.  In this way, a chain of success is created.  It reduces the chance of a cycle of failures robbing the momentum from one's drive to succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
		When there's a will to succeed, there's a way to succeed.  The way to wealth is heavily dependent upon your will.  If you're truly using your mind in a way that will help you to achieve success, it's going to impart a distinct aroma to your thoughts, words, and deeds.  Once you've put the power of thoughts into practice, opportunities you've never fathomed will become common occurrences for you.
