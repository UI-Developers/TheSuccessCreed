        <h3>Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT)</h3>
        
        <p>
        Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) is a psychological acupressure technique that can be used to help those who struggle with the types of extreme emotional ups and downs that make it hard to function optimally - physically, emotionally and financially - in a fast moving world that waits for no one.
        </p>
        <p>
        Although diet and healthy lifestyle are major factors in determining emotional well-being, EFT should not be overlooked when it comes to emotional equilibrium and emotional healing. EFT, which involves the tapping of certain acupuncture points while focusing on a specific problem and voicing audible affirmations, can bolster the natural healing powers of the body and make it possible to remove self-imposed (or externally-based) emotional roadblocks.
        </p>

        <h3>How does EFT help?...</h3>
        <p>
        EFT, which is guided by the same meridian principles detailed in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), can be used to stimulate the flow of energy throughout the body, improve the natural flow of air and breath within the respiratory system and lead to overall improved blood circulation. The kinetic energy infused into the body as a result of the tapping, combined with a clear, mental focus on a problem or issue at-hand, can restore balance within the body and lead to increased health and immunity from disease.
        </p>
        <p>
        EFT, which can be easily grasped and performed without great time and expense, can help those who struggle with emotional unbalance to: remove negative feelings and thoughts, limit the constant food cravings that lead to obesity, help set (and reach) cohesive and clear goals and better deal with the physical discomfort and emotional difficulties that are often experienced by those who suffer from chronic pain.
        </p>

        <h3>Catching up with 5,000 years of history...</h3> 
        <p>
        In the West, the theory of electromagnetic energies moving within the human system are only recently being acknowledged as worthy of inspection. In other parts of the world, however, the concept of alchemy and energy flow within a vast network of meridians is the basis for a comprehensive health and wellness acumen that has been relied upon for centuries.
        </p>
        <p>
        EFT, while foregoing the needles used in acupuncture, serves to clear the body of energy blockages by combining the tapping techniques with focused, vocal affirmations. With the meridians and channels free of blockage, a holistic health can be achieved that will result in emotional well-being, general happiness, improved disease prevention  and the freedom to function at high levels in pursuit of health, love, knowledge, riches and whatever else the heart desires.
