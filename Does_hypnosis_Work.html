        <h3>Does Hypnosis Work?</h3>
        
        <p>
        Hypnosis is already regarded as a popular treatment for those looking to lose weight, stop smoking and/or learn how to better handle stress-related issues. It is relied upon by specialists to help folks achieve optimal performance when it comes to business, sports and relationships and is recognized as a viable form of alternative holistic medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
        But it is important to recognize that hypnosis is not simply a stop-gap measure for tackling issues and so-to-speak 'trying' to improve upon a condition or attitude. This is no sugar pill. Hypnosis is a powerful, mission-critical tool for allowing oneself to install fundamental changes, at a subconscious level, that can lead to powerful shifts for the overall betterment of peace of mind and overall ability.
        </p>

        <h3>How does hypnosis work?</h3>
        <p>
        Some hypnotherapists suggest that how hypnosis works has to do with brain wave frequencies. In a hypnotic state, brain wave frequencies tend to slow down and one can more fully concentrate their focus with much greater awareness. In this state of focused awareness the brain is less able to filter out suggestion.
        </p>
        <p>
        In this state, the subconscious (or unconscious) can be instructed to free itself of attitudes, developed routines and cycles of negativity that inhibit one's ability to function at a productive level. Once the subconscious has been cleared of these self-limiting beliefs and patterns, the empty space can be filled with powerful and positive suggestions of affirmation that the subconscious mind can grasp and maintain.
        </p>

        <h3>A focused mind is a powerful tool</h3> 
        <p>
        Once someone has been able to let go of self-limiting thoughts, beliefs and patterns and clear their mind of negative chatter, there is limitless potential for the creation and introduction of productive new ideas and thoughts. This is what makes hypnotism such a powerful tool for those who struggle to escape the shackles of self-limiting thought.
        </p>
        <p>
        The power of sheer will is unstoppable, indeed, but before there can be will there must be belief. Once someone believes in their ability to perform a function or accomplish a mission (or anything else), they certainly have the ability to will the results. But, first and foremost, the belief must be there. There are plenty of folks who dismiss the power of will as a clich&eacute;, but the truth is that with a positive and focused mind one can will just about anything to happen: financial freedom can be gained, and physical and emotional equilibrium can culminate into a wildly happy and fulfilling existence.
