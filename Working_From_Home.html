        <h3>Working From Home</h3>
        
        <p>
        One of the most profound ways in which the Internet has changed the world has to do with the way people work. Gone are the days of servitude to an ungrateful master. No longer do career seekers feel the need to pay dues for ten years and slowly waste away, for approximately 40 hours a week, in a drab cubicle.
        </p>
        <p>
        Thanks to the Internet, it is now possible to create home-based business models with which one can work at home and better combine professional and family demands. Innovations in technology have made it feasible to work from home and play a more active role in, say, the raising of a family. Working from home also offers the benefit of setting your own hours and relieves the stress and pressure of relying on superiors for wage increases and performance reviews. There is no question that to be one's own boss offers enviable measures of personal and professional freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
        Working from home also offers the opportunity for more legitimate personal enrichment. Whereas a corporation will lock you into a specific position that calls for you to fill a specific role and be eligible for specific (and limited) rewards, to run a home business is to have the capability of putting a full arsenal of skills to work. A home business operator can be enriched by acting as an administrator, accountant and/or advertiser and, free of corporate dominion, can reap ALL the financial rewards of his or her hard work - instead of just helping the boss fill his or her pockets.
        </p>

        <h3>Challenges met, challenges overcome...</h3>
        <p>
        There are, however, several things to consider when it comes to running a home business. Before opting out of the office and starting your home business, it is important to recognize the challenges that can exist in a home business environment.
        Working without supervision requires the ability to self-manage. As a home business entrepreneur it is important to learn to maintain self-discipline, limit distractions and find ways to constantly set goals and challenge yourself in new and interesting ways. Setting deadlines is always a good way to ensure that things get done on time; this will help to eliminate those stressful moments when last minute obligations send your operation into disarray. Creating a system of organization will also help you avoid some of the common pitfalls facing home business owners.
        </p>

        <h3>Your way or the highway...</h3>
        
        <p>
        The other key to consider is that a big part of running a home business is not having to appease management or corporate, or for that matter anyone else. Running a home business is an opportunity to do things your way. Take time to visualize the company you want to run and how you wish to run it. Plan the work, and work the plan. And be true to your vision.
