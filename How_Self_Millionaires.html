        <h3>How Self-Made Millionaires Think</h3>
        <p>
        Nobody wants to struggle just to get by.  It's very natural for people to want to live comfortably, even luxuriously.  More often than not, however, we don't really make it where we want to be.  Only a few amongst us, a small portion of the top 1%, ever end up achieving their financial goals.  Most of those start off with a good chunk of cash from the get-go.  But there is that fascinating class of individuals, the self-made millionaires, who started out just like you and me.
        </p>
        <p>
        What is different about individuals who are able to rise from modest backgrounds to achieve financial success?  Self-made millionaires are not necessarily extraordinarily intelligent, nor do they have all have superior educational backgrounds.  What they do have is a focused mind, a vision of their future, and the ability to sustain an ongoing effort to achieve that vision.  None of these essentials are possible without the right mindset.  As we will see, there are several common bonds among self-made millionaires when it comes to their thought processes.
        </p>
        <p>
        There is so much literature out there on how to think like a millionaire, it is easy to lose track of the innovator of the field.  In the early part of the 20th century, a man named Napoleon Hill was inspired by the time he'd spent with Andrew Carnegie to extensively research and break down the way that self-made millionaires thought and acted.  It turned into a 60 year career, and his work continues to be carried out by a foundation named for him. 
        </p>
        <p>       
        Hill, like any good teacher, was a master of short, meaningful, and memorable quotations.  His most famous quotes could fill more than a dozen pages, honestly.  The main gist of his body of work, however, is that success starts in the mind.  He puts a very, very heavy emphasis on this.  So, what kinds of things go on in the minds of self-made millionaires?  How are they different from everybody else's?  Their minds are strong, determined, and focused, and they don't get crushed by failure.
        </p>
        <p>
        There are some psychological studies out there that suggest that some of these traits are inborn, related to brain development.  However, these studies focused merely on very shallow definitions of the behavior, and generally focus only on very small, specific regions of the brain.  Plus, there are other studies that suggest that the brain can reorganize itself under duress, changing pathways in order to carry out functions that the parts involved don't normally perform.  So pick whichever side you want to pick.
        </p>
        <p>
        What it all comes down to is that it's a choice.  When you choose to become single-minded, to dream big, to not let anything get in your way, to give yourself no excuse for failure, and to persist without regret no matter how many times you actually do fail... you are going to succeed.  If, on the other hand, you always find excuses to be lazy, you allow yourself to think negative, self-defeating thoughts, you fall into a pattern of maladaptive behavior, and you give up easily... you're by all intents and purposes going to fail.
        </p>
        <p> 
        Not all of us are blessed with natural gifts and a rich daddy.  However, we all have our own unique talents, and are all capable of great success if we learn how to apply ourselves correctly.  One of the most important things is to develop a strong and focused mind.  Your personal definition of success is your business.  In the grand scheme of things, we are material beings, and material success is both more measurable and more measurably (and legitimately) satisfying than moral victories.  So figure out what it is that you want to do, repeatedly tell yourself that you are more than capable of doing it, create a plan of attack, get to it, and stick to it!  What do you have to lose?
